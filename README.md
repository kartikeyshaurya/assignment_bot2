## Files in This Repository

The repository includes the following files:
- `agent_architecture.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook exploring agent-based system design. 
-  `elastic_search_geeder.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the feeding the data to the elastic search
- `helper.py`: Standartized function which is being used for our case 
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the repository.
- Any additional files required for the notebook (e.g., datasets .csv files).
- `.txt ` files contains infomation about the approach and docs about what i was thinking for the project


# 1.0 Problem Statement 

If a user is having some sympoms then it should ask the agent about the disease that he could have , the agent then will decide which tools is most suitable 


# 2.0 VectorDatabase (`elastic_search_feeder.ipynb`)
## Overview for more look for `elastic_search_feeder.txt`

The `elastic_search_feeder.ipynb` notebook is designed to facilitate the integration of data into an Elasticsearch instance. It provides a streamlined approach for feeding structured data into a vector database for efficient querying and retrieval.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare data for ingestion.
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Code snippets and examples for connecting to an Elasticsearch instance.
- **Indexing**: Methods for creating and populating indices with vectorized data.
- **Querying**: Demonstrations of how to query the vector database for relevant information.

### Use Case:
This notebook is particularly useful for projects requiring fast and scalable search capabilities, such as information retrieval systems or recommendation engines.



# 3.0 Agent Architecture - `agent_architecture.ipynb`

## Overview for more look for `agent_architecture.txt`

The `agent_architecture.ipynb` notebook delves into the design and implementation of an agent-based system capable of decision-making and task execution.

### Key Features:
- **Agent Design**: Explanation of the architecture and components of the agent.
- **Decision-Making**: Algorithms and logic used by the agent to make informed decisions.
- **Tool Selection**: Mechanisms for selecting the most appropriate tools based on user input and context.
- **Simulation**: Examples of simulated scenarios to demonstrate the agent's functionality.

### Use Case:
This notebook is ideal for projects involving intelligent systems that require dynamic decision-making, such as virtual assistants or diagnostic tools.
